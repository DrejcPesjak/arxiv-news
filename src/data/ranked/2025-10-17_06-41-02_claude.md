## ðŸŽ¯ Top 5 Most Relevant Articles for Your PhD in LLM Interpretability:

### 1. **"Do LLMs 'Feel'? Emotion Circuits Discovery and Control"** (Article 96/13)
**Why:** This is THE premier mechanistic interpretability paper in this batch. First systematic study to uncover and validate **emotion circuits** in LLMs. Identifies context-agnostic emotion directions, specific neurons and attention heads implementing emotional computation through causal analysis. Quantifies each sublayer's causal influence and integrates components into global emotion circuits. Achieves 99.65% emotion control accuracy by directly modulating circuits. Pure circuit-level mechanistic interpretability with rigorous causal validation.

### 2. **"Credal Transformer: A Principled Approach for Quantifying and Mitigating Hallucinations"** (Article 72)
**Why:** Proposes fundamental architectural change to Transformers. Replaces Softmax with **Credal Attention Mechanism (CAM)** based on evidential theory that produces "credal sets" (sets of distributions) instead of single attention vectors. The set size directly measures model uncertainty at each layer. Reconceptualizes attention scores as evidence masses for Dirichlet distribution. Provides principled uncertainty quantification integrated directly into architecture rather than post-hoc. This represents a new paradigm for building interpretable-by-design models.

### 3. **"Narrow Finetuning Leaves Clearly Readable Traces in Activation Differences"** (Article 47)
**Why:** Demonstrates that narrow finetuning creates **strong biases in LLM activations** that can be interpreted through simple model diffing. Analyzing activation differences on first few tokens reveals finetuning domain. Shows these biases reflect overfitting and can be largely removed by mixing pretraining data. Critical for: (1) understanding effects of finetuning on representations, (2) warning that narrowly finetuned models may not be realistic proxies for studying broader alignment, (3) highlights need for better interpretability case studies. Spans multiple architectures (Gemma, LLaMA, Qwen) and scales (1B-32B).

### 4. **"Hierarchical Alignment: Surgical Fine-Tuning via Functional Layer Specialization"** (Article 78)
**Why:** Challenges monolithic optimization by introducing **targeted alignment to functional blocks**: local layers (syntax), intermediate layers (logic), and global layers (factuality). Demonstrates that different layers have distinct functional specializations. Shows that aligning global layers improves both factual consistency AND logical coherence (most effective strategy). All hierarchical strategies avoid "alignment tax" where gains in fluency degrade reasoning. Provides resource-efficient, controllable, and interpretable path through **structure-aware surgical fine-tuning**. Fundamental for understanding functional specialization in transformers.

### 5. **"Medical Interpretability and Knowledge Maps of Large Language Models"** (Article 94)
**Why:** First systematic study creating **knowledge maps** showing WHERE medical knowledge (ages, symptoms, diseases, drugs) is stored and processed across LLM layers. Uses 4 interpretability techniques: UMAP projections, gradient-based saliency, layer lesioning, activation patching. Key findings for Llama3.3-70B: (i) most medical knowledge processed in first half of layers, (ii) age encoded non-linearly and discontinuously, (iii) disease progression representation is non-monotonic and circular at certain layers, (iv) drugs cluster by medical specialty rather than mechanism. Provides concrete guidance on which layers to target for fine-tuning, unlearning, or de-biasing. Demonstrates practical application of interpretability for domain-specific knowledge localization.
